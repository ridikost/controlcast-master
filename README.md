## What does it do?
ControlCast allows you to take control of your broadcast with a Launchpad Controller with hotkeys.

## What Launchpad Devices work with ControlCast?
* Launchpad Mini
* Launchpad S
* Launchpad MK1

## How does it work?
Most streaming software (OBS, XSplit) let you bind hotkeys to perform certain tasks when streaming to services like Twitch. Tasks like Start/Stop the stream, switching scenes, and muting your microphone. And 3rd party voice services often offer 'toggle to mute' or 'hold to mute' keybinds. (Discord, Skype, Teamspeak)

Edit individual midi keys to:
* ``Send`` or ``Hold`` a configured hotkey combination.
* Play a local or remote audio file.
* Show images or gifs in an overlay with animations.

## Updating
* Updates are downloaded and applied automatically in the background.
* When presented with the update icon in the upper right of the app, click to close and reopen to latest version.
* Config settings remain persistent between updates.
* WARNING: Reinstalling via the Setup.exe file will override the config file.

Woopra is used for anylitics. No personal information is gathered. I'm mostly just curious how many ControlCast are out there in the world.
It will also let me see what features are most/least used in the app. Pretty neat.
